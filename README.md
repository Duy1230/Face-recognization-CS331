# Face Recognition with Eye-State Anti-Spoofing

This project implements a **face recognition system with eye-state anti-spoofing**, leveraging deep learning models for face detection and recognition. It uses the **FaceNet-PyTorch** library for face embedding and classification, combined with **OpenCV** for image processing.

## Features
- **Face Detection & Recognition** using MTCNN and InceptionResnetV1.
- **Eye-State Anti-Spoofing** to detect closed vs. open eyes, preventing spoof attacks.
- **GUI Interface** built with Tkinter and ttkbootstrap.
- **Image & Video Processing** using OpenCV.

## Installation
